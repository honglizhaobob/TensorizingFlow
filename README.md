# Tensorizing Flow for Variational Inference

This repository contains code for the paper (Tensorizing-Flows: A Tool for Variational Inference). The normalizing flow training tests are contained in the folder `./code/training/`. Prior to running the normalizing flow experiments, sample data from respective high dimensional densities should be generated by executing the MATLAB code files in `./code/sampling/` and exported to the `./code/data/` folder with appropriate filenames
